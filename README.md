## HSJ Technical Task Repository

This repository contains the main files used to complete the HSJ technical task. The final write-up is provided as an HTML file named "Brucek Documentation".

This project was both fun and engaging, and I appreciated the opportunity to participate. The results presented here reflect what could be accomplished within the suggested 4-5 hour timeframe. Although I would have liked to delve further, particularly in refining the linear optimization model, I cut myself off after a 5-hour investment.

I look forward to discussing the approaches and code when we meet next!
